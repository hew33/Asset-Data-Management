# Asset-Data-Management
VBA with Excel
## Project Purpose
I received two types of database, containing not necessarily the same companies and not necessarily for the same years. I needed to organizing those two different databases into one organized database, with companies and years in common.

## Steps in the project
1. Read the company from dataset 2, copy all the rows into the output file, and use do while loop to go to the last cell in which the company mentioned in dataset 2
2. Add a row and add a label "Stock Price Average" in the output file after each company's section
3. Go to dataset1 and find the company and calculate the annual average stock price of each company in each year, store the averages into the output file
4. Add a row below the row of stock price average and calculate the year over year percentage change
5. Go to the last column and for each row, using a do while loop to calculate the average of each property for the last 10 years
